# **Tetris**

## About
A tetris clone somewhat similar to the NES version of Tetris. 
This is my first C++ project and I created it to learn more about the basics of the language. 
The .vscode folder includes build files for the program as it uses raylib.
I plan to continue expanding my knowledge of C++ through future projects.
